# TaskManager ( _React_CustomHooksApp_ )

### Overview
_Dave's TaskManager_ is my a pure React app that is just that, a "Task Manager". I used [Google Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/) to persist the tasks data to and from the backend / database. I built this for fun while teaching myself React and how to make _Custom Hooks_.

### Technologies
* JavaScript, React
* [Google Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/)
* Custom React Hooks
* OOP fundamentals:
  * Inheritance
  * Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
 This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
